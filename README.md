<p>
This a preliminary version of C++ based open source library COPT. 
The basic idea is to provide an easy-to-use library for implementing optimization algorithms. 
COPT mainly contains two parts: Mathematical structures as vector, dense matrix, sparse matrix and so on; Easy-to-followr solver framework.
The library is powered by MathU organization in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 
The leaders are Zhouwang Yang, associated professor in USTC and Ruimin Wang, PhD candidate in USTC.
